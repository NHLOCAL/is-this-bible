# is this a bible?
 An IA model that detects whether a given verse is from the Bible or not

The model presents capabilities at a very high recognition level, for the Hebrew language.
The complete dataset on which the model was trained is stored in the `bible_data.csv` file.

You can try the model's capabilities easily, by downloading the model files `is_this_bible_model.pkl`, `is_this_bible_vectorizer.pkl`, together with the file `try_model.py`.
